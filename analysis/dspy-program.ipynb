The floor is yours and we'll set the stage, just bring the words... but please limit to around 750 (or 5 minutes). We'll spend another 5 minutes discussing your work, if you'd like. But make sure to let us know prior if you're wanting critique or if you just prefer us to keep our thoughts to ourselves.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"mb-4\\\"><strong>9:00 - 10:00</strong> This is social hour. Meet a new friend or connect with those you already know.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"mb-4\\\">If you have any questions, just email me at: <a href=\\\"http://dan@lyricagency.com\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\" class=\\\"!text-viridian\\\" rel=\\\"nofollow ugc\\\">dan@lyricagency.com</a></p>\\n<p class=\\\"mb-4\\\">Again, our meetups are scheduled for every Thursdays at 6pm and hosted in a small creative agency office situated at the storefront on 8 St. Marks Place in Manhattan (you need to walk down a few steps). We're just a few steps from Cooper Square and the Astor Place stop.</p>\\n<p class=\\\"mb-4\\\">See you there.</p></div></div>\", \"hosts\": [\"Dan S.\"], \"group\": \"New York City Creative Writing
